[__1. Laboratory work 1a__](https://github.com/cyberknopa/Python/blob/main/TIMP/Lab_1.py)

Develop a program that prohibits the creation, copying or renaming of 
files with specified names in the current (the one where it is located) directory 
(you can use file masks). The list of names or their templates should be stored in the template.tbl file as text. 
This file must be protected from deletion, unauthorized viewing and modification. When installing the program, 
you can provide for disabling it using the password stored in the first line of the template.tbl file in hashed form. 
The program must enable and disable the protection mode.
